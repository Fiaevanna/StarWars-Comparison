        <h1>STAR WARS</h1>

        <h2>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...</h2>
        <p>
          It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden
          base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.
          During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the
          Empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR, and space station with
          enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's
          sinister agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship,
          custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore
          freedom to the galaxy.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a dark time for the Rebellion. Although the Death Star has been
          destroyed, Imperial troops have driven the Rebel forces from their
          hidden base and pursued them across the galaxy. Evading the dreaded
          Imperial Starfleet, a group of freedom fighters led by Luke Skywalker
          has established a new secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth. The
          evil lord Darth Vader, obsessed with finding young Skywalker, has
          dispatched thousands of remote probes into the far reaches of space
        </p>
        <p>
          Luke Skywalker has returned to his home planet of Tatooine in an
          attempt to rescue his friend Han Solo from the clutches of the vile
          gangster Jabba the Hutt. Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC
          EMPIRE has secretly begun construction on a new armored space station
          even more powerful than the first dreaded Death Star. When completed,
          this ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of
          rebels struggling to restore freedom to the galaxy…
        </p>
        <p>
          Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade
          routes to outlying star systems is in dispute. Hoping to resolve the
          matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the greedy Trade
          Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of Naboo.
          While the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming
          chain of events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two
          Jedi Knights, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to
          settle the conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar systems
          have declared their intentions to leave the Republic. This separatist
          movement, under the leadership of the mysterious Count Dooku, has made
          it difficult for the limited number of Jedi Knights to maintain peace
          and order in the galaxy. Senator Amidala, the former Queen of Naboo,
          is returning to the Galactic Senate to vote on the critical issue of
          creating an ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC to assist the overwhelmed Jedi.
        </p>
        <p>
          War! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless Sith
          Lord, Count Dooku. There are heroes on both sides. Evil is everywhere.
          In a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, General Grievous, has
          swept into the Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine,
          leader of the Galactic Senate. As the Separatist Droid Army attempts
          to flee the besieged capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi
          Knights lead a desperate mission to rescue the captive Chancellor
        </p>

          Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence, the sinister FIRST ORDER
          has risen from the ashes of the Empire and will not rest until
          Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed. With the support of the
          REPUBLIC, General Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is
          desperate to find her brother Luke and gain his help in restoring
          peace and justice to the galaxy. Leia has sent her most daring pilot
          on a secret mission to Jakku, where an old ally has discovered a clue
          to Luke's whereabouts
